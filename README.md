# CS204 Advanced Programming #

###Description and objectives###
- This course aims to provide programming experience and to give advanced
programming techniques. In this way, students would be more prepared to data
structures and several other junior and senior level CS courses. CS204 is a
prerequisite course for several CS courses including data structures. Thus, it is a
must course for CS students and students who will take advanced CS courses.
- The programming language that will be used in this course is C++; we will use
Microsoft Visual C++ as the main development environment.

###Topics planned to be covered###
* Introduction (overview of basic concepts, Visual C++ environment, preprocessor
directives, compiler, compiler options, linker, libraries, debugging)
* Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
* Linked lists and basic trees
* Stacks and queues
* Templates, templated classes and functions
* Advanced issues on classes and object oriented programming
* Data representation, bitwise operations
* Inheritance, polymorphism and advanced object oriented design
* Exception handling
* Programming with threads and concurrency in C++
* Visual programming and graphical user interfaces with Qt
